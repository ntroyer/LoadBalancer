LoadBalancer
============

Python work I did for a lab in class on Load Balancing.

One of the goals of the lab was to write a randomized load balancer in Python that would compute maximum line length
(represented in the code by the function loadBalancer), then create a plot comparing the maximum line length of the 
load balancer to the theoretical maximum line length by Mitzenmacher and Upfal (represented by num7 in the code).  
We then did this again with another value, d, then plotted the maximum line length of the modified load balancer 
(represented by modLoadBalancer and num10, respectively.

The second part of the lab was to write a randomized load balancer in Python that would compute link capacity using
either naive routing or valiant routing as determined by the user, then print graphs that would show the best and
worst cases of naive routing and valiant routing.  The ultimate goal was to show the advantages and disadvantages
of routing.
